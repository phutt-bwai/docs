## Graph-Based Recommendation Engine

### Intelligent Similarity Framework

At the heart of our recommendation system lies a sophisticated graph-based approach that measures similarity between users, content, and opportunities. Every recommendation relies on finding entities that are "close" in behavior, interests, or characteristics.

### Similarity Analysis Types

**User-User Similarity:**
- Identifies wallets with similar trading patterns and portfolio compositions
- Analyzes shared DeFi activities, mutual follows, and risk patterns
- Uses cosine similarity and behavioral correlation metrics
- Output: "Wallets similar to you" recommendations

**User-Content Similarity:**
- Matches your profile to relevant opportunities and research
- Compares token holdings, risk appetite, and yield preferences
- Weighted scoring prioritizes important features
- Output: Personalized content and investment suggestions

**Content-Content Similarity:**
- Finds related opportunities and "More Like This" suggestions
- Analyzes token/protocol overlap and user engagement patterns
- Identifies complementary content and sequential recommendations
- Output: Related research and diversification suggestions

### Technical Implementation

**Vector Construction:**
Our system converts user behavior and content characteristics into mathematical vectors for precise similarity calculations.

**Data Sources:**
- On-chain: Transactions, staking, governance participation
- Off-chain: Page views, alert subscriptions, social interactions
- Market data: Prices, volumes, liquidity metrics
- Social signals: Sentiment analysis and community trends

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Feature Engineering**: Convert raw data into meaningful metrics
2. **Normalization**: Scale all features to prevent bias
3. **Similarity Computation**: Calculate relationships between entities
4. **Ranking & Filtering**: Apply business rules and quality thresholds
